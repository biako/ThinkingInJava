 * Thinking in Java p614-615
 *
 *
 * I. Effective Java a basic recipe for generating a decent hashCode()
 *
 * 1. Store some constant nonzero value, say 17, in an int variable called result.
 * 2. For each significant field fin your object (that is, each field taken into
 * account by the equals( ) method), calculate an int hash code c for the field:
 *
 *       boolean:  c = ( f ? 0 : 1)
 *       byte, char, short, or int: c = (int)f
 *       long: c = (int)(f ^ (f>>>32))
 *       float: c = Float.floatToIntBits(f);
 *       double:  long l = Double.doubleToLongBits(f); c = (int)(1 ^ (l>>>32))
 *       Object, where equals( ) calls equals( ) for this field: c = f.hashCode( )
 *       Array: Apply above rules to each element
 * *
 * 3. Combine the hash code(s) computed above: result = 37 * result + c;
 * 4. Return result.
 * 5. Look at the resulting hashCode( ) and make sure that equal instances have equal hash codes.
 *
 * II. Explanation of CountedString
 *
 * CountedString includes a String and an id that represents the number of
 * CountedString objects that contain an identical String. The counting is
 * accomplished in the constructor by iterating through the static ArrayList
 * where all the Strings are stored.
 *
 * Both hashCode( ) and equals( ) produce results based on both fields;
 * if they were just based on the String alone or the id alone, there would be duplicate matches for distinct values.
