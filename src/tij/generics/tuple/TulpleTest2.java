 *
 * Thinking in Java p455
 *
 * Notice that f( ) returns a parameterized TwoTuple object,
 * while f2( ) returns an unparameterized TwoTuple object.
 *
 * The compiler doesnâ€™t warn about f2( ) in this case because
 * the return value is not being used in a parameterized fashion;
 * in a sense, it is being "upcast" to an unparameterized TwoTuple.
 *
 * However, if you were to try to capture the result of f2( ) into a
 * parameterized TwoTuple, the compiler would issue a warning.
